Trip distribution across different times of day, days of the week, and locations.
The relationship between trip length and fare amount.
Payment trends and tipping behaviors.

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can enhance taxi service:

1. Optimize Taxi Availability: Focus on peak travel times, particularly 7-9 AM and 3-6 PM.
2. Target Marketing on Tuesdays: Since Tuesday has the highest trip volume, marketing campaigns could be especially effective on this day.
3. Promote Street Hail Usage: As most passengers use street hail, campaigns encouraging this option could boost usage.
4. Encourage Credit Card Payments: With higher tipping linked to credit card usage, promoting cashless payments may increase tips.
5. Improve Service in East Harlem and Manhattan: Given their large share of pick-up and drop-off activities, optimizing resources in these areas can enhance operational efficiency.
